Dispersion spectra of Twisted Bi-layer graphene

This project examines the Dispersion relation of a moire-lattice, 2 hexagonal layers in this case. The techniques and calculations are summarized in the paper Theory for Twisted Bilayer Photonic Crystal Slabs (https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.136101).
